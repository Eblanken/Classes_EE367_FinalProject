TODO NICE MARKDOWN README

Before running the script you need to be in the proper environment. You can
accomplish this by navigating to the "Utils" folder in your terminal and typing
"conda env create -f stereoEnviron.yml". You would then activate the environment
after packages are installed by typing the command "conda activate stereoEnviron".
You then need to add the kernel to those accessable to Jupiter Notebooks, this is
accomplished with the command "python -m ipykernel install --user --name=stereoEnviron".

Now open the evaluation script. Make sure to select "stereoEnviron" from the kernel list. Run the cells in order. Note that some of them, especially those that import image data, can take a very long time.

If you run into issues, please reach out to me directly.
